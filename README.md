# AtliQ-Hospitality-Analysis
### ðŸ“ŒCompany: AtliQ Grands (Luxury & Business Hotels)

AtliQ Grands, a premium hotel chain in India, faced declining market share and revenue due to competitive pressure and ineffective decision-making. To regain its position, the management sought data-driven insights but lacked an in-house analytics team. As a result, they engaged third-party data analysts to analyze their historical revenue data and uncover key business trends.
